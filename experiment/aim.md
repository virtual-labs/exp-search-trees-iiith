In this experiment, you will use binary trees to support dictionary operations such as Insert(), Delete(), Find(). This data structure is called a binary search tree. A binary search tree is a binary tree with the restriction that the value at any node is bigger than the values of all the items in the left subtree and is smaller than the values of all the elements in the right subtree.
